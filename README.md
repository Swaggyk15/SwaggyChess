SwaggyChess

Hello! My name is Kenny Monterroso and I have built a simple Chess GUI using
Java. Personally, I have played chess for about 3 years! As a result of this, I 
wanted to build a GUI to allow the user to play a simple game of chess! 
Prior to this, I had never used Java, and since I wanted to learn more about how the 
language itself, I decided to take on the task of developing something I enjoy while 
learning a new technology. Despite this, this project still has much more potential as 
I would like to add a database to keep track of all gamea a user has played, as well as 
possibly include an AI to play against in the near future. Also, if you would like to 
play chess, feel free to add me on chess.com: swayyk!

How can you run this project?
- copy the repository from my github
- clone the repo to your local machine
- open the project onto your java ide (I used IntelliJ for this!)
- compile and run the Main.java file

Helpful Resoruces:
- YouTube - RyiSnow (How to Code Chess in Java), was a fantastic beginner resource for learning how to develop
  a chess GUI especially for people like me, who are new to Java!
